# JavaScriptMN
This site is generated with [Gatsby.js](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).

## Prerequisites
Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Develop
Run `npm develop` and access the dev server at the address it reports.

## Build
Run `npm build`, and a built version will be written to `/public`. This will
also update the markdown files that define our code of conduct, speaker
questionnaire, and sponsorship levels from the [admin repository](https://github.com/javascriptmn/javascriptmn)
